## Spirometer Prototype

### Introduction
A spirometer is an apparatus that is used to measure how
much air capacity a pair of lungs could hold, by measuring the
inhaled and exhaled air volume.
<br>
It is a course project under `Manufacturing and Workshop Practice`, IITGN'
<br><br>
The goal of our project is to create a Spirometer prototype for
measuring lung capacity. It consists of a `slotted disk`, `rotary
encoder`, and a `NodeMCU` to determine the speed of the
impeller's rotation.

### Materials Used
* Acrylic(Transparent)
* PLA
* MDF sheets
* Polyurethane
* LM393 rotary encoder
* NodeMCU
* Breadboard
* Male to female Jumper wires
* Type-B USB Cables

### Methods and Tools used for manufacturing different parts
* Laser Cutting Machine
* 3-D printer
* Autodesk Fusion 360

All the dimensions and materials were chosen arbitrarily on the basis of cost, properties required and availability.

### Files and Folders
* `DXF Files`: These files contain the design of different parts of the spirometer and using it in laser cutting machine
* `stl file` : The impeller design for 3-d printer
* `Final assembly_1001.f3z`: The final prototype assembly
* `.mov file`: For video presentation of the prototype
* `report.pdf`: It contains the final report of the project

### Conclusion
We learned to design various components of a product such
that it is manufacturable by taking the tolerances into account
and eventually understanding the caveats of assembly.
